# autodw

install the modules <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>

then just <br>
`python automate_hw.py` <br>

then simply follow the directions that the program asks of you <br>
BY THE WAY, you need to change these variables in beginning of `automate_hw.py` to suit yourself <br>
```
# change these variables to suit yourself
gituser = "rwang2022"
last3first = "WangRya"
pd = 4
passwd = getpass.getpass("Please type your password here: ")
```
I suggest changing all 4 variables, simply setting password to a plaintext string (I know, I know)
